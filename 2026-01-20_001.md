Okay, making this note at the start of the day instead of the end of it. I intend to complete Chapter 4: Recursion of the Python course on Boot.dev. I will figure out some time to do it, whether at the office or at home.

End of day update

Too busy at work to code. Going to read my coding book to try and get sleepy.
