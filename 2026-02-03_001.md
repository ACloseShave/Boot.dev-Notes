Need to get back to this, but feeling stuck and like it isn't helping me learn the "dev" part of DevOps.

On the positive side I saw a chunk of code in an Instagram reel the other day and immediately knew it was Python so I am getting some code recognition. It was a chunk of a Python function to un-redact items from a certain list of files.

I could even recognize some of the tools it imported at the type like `os` and knew where it wasbeing used in the program.
